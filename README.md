# VoronoiDijkstra
Quick web app I made for my robotics class. Finds voronoi decomposition for a selection of shapes, then the shortest path between two points using the voronoi decomposition using Dijkstra's.

How to run:
1) Run main.html in any browser.
2) Make sure button on right side of canvas read obstacle.
3) Draw any combination of shapes (works best on convex shapes that are of decent size and distance apart).
4) Voronoi decomposition should be drawn after each shape.
5) Click button, then press anywhere to select start point.
6) Click button, then press anywhere to select end point.
7) Wait for a minute, and the shortest path should be found (you can open console to see progress).
